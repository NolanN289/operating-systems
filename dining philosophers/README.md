=========================== HOW TO RUN =========================

Step 1: Open VS Code with WSL extension. We have used Linux to compile the code.

Step 2: Open Terminal with WSL. Ensure code can compile with 
        given compiler in Linux. (NOTE: I have used g++ dining_problem.cpp)

Step 3: Upon successful compilation, call the .exe or .out file, in my case I have called
        using "./a.out"

Step 4: After typing the execute, look in the terminal to see the outputs being printed.

        For example: 
                        Philosopher 0 is thinking.
                        Philosopher 1 is thinking.
                        Philosopher 2 is thinking.
                        Philosopher 3 is thinking.
                        Philosopher 4 is thinking.
                        Philosopher 4 spent 1000 ms thinking.
                        Philosopher 4 is hungry.
                        Philosopher 4 is eating.
                        Philosopher 1 spent 2000 ms thinking.
                        Philosopher 1 is hungry.
